If you wish to embed GeoIP database into qBittorrent executable, please download put GeoIP.dat in this folder.

GeoIP Database can be downloaded from here:
* http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz
Note that the database should be uncompressed.

Embedding GeoIP database into qBittorrent executable is advised for:
* Windows
* Mac OS X
* Linux distributions that don't provide GeoIP database in a separate package

On Linux operating system, since this is not the default behavior, you also need to pass --with-geoip-database-embedded parameter to the configure file.
